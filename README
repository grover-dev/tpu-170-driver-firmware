Firmware repo for adoresat/trashsat/bsasat


For compiling we use a makefile:

make <target>

Current targets:

lpc822

Programming:
Currently using an LPC Link2 flashed with jlink firmware. Highly suggest using Segger's Ozone (excellent ARM debugging software). A configuration file for this project is provided in the jlink folder. Simply load the .jlink and you should be able to easily upload code/start debugging.
